### Flask web server (NOT FOR PRODUCTION)

If your CAS is located at `https://sso.pdx.edu/`

```sh
python app.py --debug True --cas_server "https://sso.pdx.edu"
```

### Gunicorn

If your CAS is located at `https://sso.pdx.edu/`

You need to add two environment variables `CAS_SERVER` and `SECRET_KEY`
before you can run gunicorn.

1. Add `CAS_SERVER` `export CAS_SERVER="https://sso.pdx.edu/"`
2. Add `SECRET_KEY` `export SECRET_KEY=[its a secret]`
3. Run it `gunicorn app:app`

### Heroku

Its ready to go. All you have to do is make an account and upload it.
You will need to set up the enviroment like gunicorn.
